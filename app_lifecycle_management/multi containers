# Multi-container Pods Design Patterns
# There are 3 common patterns, when it comes to designing multi-container PODs. The first and what we just saw with the logging service example is known as a side car pattern. The others are the adapter and the ambassador pattern.

# But these fall under the CKAD curriculum and are not required for the CKA exam. So we will be discuss these in more detail in the CKAD course.
